# 1.Introduction
## Defining Software Architecture
![](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/assets/fosa_0102.png)

Figure 1-2. Architecture consists of the structure combined with architecture characteristics (“-ilities”), architecture decisions, and design principles

The `structure` of the system, as illustrated in Figure 1-3, refers to the type of architecture style (or styles) the system is implemented in (such as microservices, layered, or microkernel).

Figure 1-3. Structure refers to the type of architecture styles used in the system

The `architecture characteristics` define the success criteria of a system, which is generally orthogonal to the functionality of the system.

Figure 1-4. Architecture characteristics refers to the “-ilities” that the system must support

`Architecture decisions` define the rules for how a system should be constructed.

Figure 1-5. Architecture decisions are rules for constructing systems

If a particular architecture decision cannot be implemented in one part of the system due to some condition or other constraint, that decision (or rule) can be broken through something called a `variance`.

A `design principle` differs from an architecture decision in that a design principle is a guideline rather than a hard-and-fast `rule`.

## Laws of Software Architecture
First Law of Software Architecture:

>Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.

Second Law of Software Architecture:

>Why is more important than how.

## Architecture Versus Design

## Technical Breadth
A developer’s early career focuses on expanding the top of the pyramid, to build experience and expertise.

Figure 2-5. Developers must maintain expertise to retain it

Unlike a developer, who must have a significant amount of `technical depth` to perform their job, a software architect must have a significant amount of `technical breadth` to think like an architect and see things with an architecture point of view.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/assets/fosa_0206.png)

Figure 2-6. What someone knows is technical depth, and how much someone knows is technical breadth

As an architect, breadth is more important than depth. Because architects must make decisions that match capabilities to technical constraints, a broad understanding of a wide variety of solutions is valuable. Thus, for an architect, **the wise course of action is to sacrifice some hard-won expertise and use that time to broaden their portfolio**, as shown in Figure 2-7.

## Analyzing Trade-Offs
To quote Mark (one of your authors):

>Architecture is the stuff you can’t Google.

**Everything in architecture is a trade-off**, which is why the famous answer to every architecture question in the universe is “it depends.” 

To quote Neal (another one of your authors):

>There are no right or wrong answers in architecture—only trade-offs.

To quote Rich Hickey, the creator of the Clojure programming language:

>Programmers know the benefits of everything and the trade-offs of nothing. Architects need to understand both.

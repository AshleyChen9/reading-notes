# 1.Introduction
## Defining Software Architecture

Figure 1-2. Architecture consists of the structure combined with architecture characteristics (“-ilities”), architecture decisions, and design principles

The `structure` of the system, as illustrated in Figure 1-3, refers to the type of architecture style (or styles) the system is implemented in (such as microservices, layered, or microkernel).

Figure 1-3. Structure refers to the type of architecture styles used in the system

The `architecture characteristics` define the success criteria of a system, which is generally orthogonal to the functionality of the system.

Figure 1-4. Architecture characteristics refers to the “-ilities” that the system must support

`Architecture decisions` define the rules for how a system should be constructed.

Figure 1-5. Architecture decisions are rules for constructing systems

If a particular architecture decision cannot be implemented in one part of the system due to some condition or other constraint, that decision (or rule) can be broken through something called a `variance`.

A `design principle` differs from an architecture decision in that a design principle is a guideline rather than a hard-and-fast `rule`.

## Laws of Software Architecture
First Law of Software Architecture:

>Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.

Second Law of Software Architecture:

>Why is more important than how.

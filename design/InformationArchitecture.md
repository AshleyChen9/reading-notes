# I.Introducing Information Architecture
`Information architecture` (IA) is a design discipline that is focused on making information findable and understandable.

## 1.The Problems That Information Architecture Addresses
### Recap
- Historically, information has shown a tendency to dematerialize, going from having a one-to-one relationship with its containers to being completely detached from its containers (as is the case with our digital information).
- This has had two important effects in our time: information is more abundant than ever before, and we have more ways of interacting with it than ever before.
- Information architecture is focused on making information findable and understandable. Because of this, it is uniquely well suited to address these issues.
- It does this by asking the designer to think about problems through two important perspectives: that our products and services are perceived as places made of information, and that they function as ecosystems that can be designed for maximum effectiveness.
- That said, information architecture doesn’t operate solely at the level of abstractions: for it to be effective, it needs to be defined at various levels.

## 2.Defining Information Architecture
### Definitions
Let’s start by clarifying what we mean by information architecture:

1. The structural design of shared information environments
2. The synthesis of organization, labeling, search, and navigation systems within digital, physical, and cross-channel ecosystems
3. The art and science of shaping information products and experiences to support usability, findability, and understanding
4. An emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape

### The “Too-Simple” Information Model

Figure 3-1. The “too-simple” model of information needs

Or, expressed as a simple algorithm:		

1. User asks a question.			
2. Something happens (i.e., searching or browsing).			
3. User receives the answer.			
4. Fin.

### Information Needs
When you’re hoping to make the perfect catch, you usually know what you’re looking for, what to call it, and where you’ll find it—this is called `known-item` seeking. An example is when you search the staff directory to find a colleague’s phone number.

When you’re hoping to find a few useful items in your traps, you’re doing something called `exploratory seeking`. In this case, you’re not exactly sure what you’re looking for. In fact, whether you realize it or not, you’re looking to learn something from the process of searching and browsing. For example, a user may go to his employer’s human resources site to learn something about retirement plans that the company offers.

When you want everything, you’re performing `exhaustive research`. You’re looking for everything available on a particular topic, hoping to leave no stone unturned. In this case, the user often has many ways to express what she’s looking for, and may have the patience to construct her search using all those varied terms. For example, someone who is trying to learn more about a friend’s medical condition might execute multiple searches for “AIDS,” “HIV,” “acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome,” and so forth.

Finally, our failing memories and busy schedules continually force us to engage in `refinding pieces` of useful information that we’ve happened upon before. For example, while you’re at work, you might surf for a few minutes and stumble on a great but long explanation of Django Reinhardt’s guitar technique. Naturally, you won’t read it now and risk losing your job. You’ll refind it later instead, or use a “read later” service such as Instapaper to return to it at a more convenient time.

Figure 3-2 illustrates these four different types of information needs.

### Information-Seeking Behaviors
`Searching`, `browsing`, and `asking` are all methods for finding, and these are the basic building blocks of information-seeking behavior.

There are two other major aspects to seeking behaviors: `integration` and `iteration`. We often integrate searching, browsing, and asking in the same finding session. Figure 3-3 shows how you might search your corporate intranet for guidelines on traveling abroad.

Figure 3-3. Integrated browsing, searching, and asking over many iterations

In this model (shown in Figure 3-4), users start with an information need, formulate an information request (a query), and then move iteratively through an information system along potentially complex paths, picking bits of information (“berries”) along the way. In the process, they modify their information requests as they learn more about what they need and what information is available from the system.

Figure 3-4. The `“berry-picking”` model of how users move through an information system

Another useful model is the `“pearl-growing”` approach. Users start with one or a few good documents that are exactly what they need. They want to get “more like this one.” 

Corporate websites and intranets often utilize a `“two-step”` model. Confronted with a site consisting of links to perhaps hundreds of departmental subsites, users first need to know where to look for the information they need. They might search or browse through a directory until they find a good candidate or two, and then perform the second step: looking for information within those subsites.

### Recap

- IA starts with people and the reason they use your product or service: they have an information need.
- There are different models of what happens when people look for information.
- The most simple of these is problematic, because it doesn’t accurately represent what actually happens when people have an information need.
- Information needs are like fishing: sometimes people know exactly what they’re looking for, but often they’re casting a wider net.
- People act on these information needs through various information-seeking behaviors.
- There are various research methods that allow us to learn about these behaviors.

## 4.Design for Understanding
### A Sense of Place
When we talk about digital media, we use metaphors that betray a sense of place: we “go” online, “visit” a website, “browse” Amazon.com. Increasingly, these environments are also taking over many of the functions we’ve traditionally associated with physical places: we meet with our friends in WhatsApp, pay our bills in our bank’s website, learn in Khan Academy. As with physical places, we experience them as contexts that differ from one another, supporting different needs.

### Places Made of Information

Figure 4-2. Banks and hospitals serve different information needs; their website navigation structures highlight the differences between them, and you understand the information they present in the context of the roles and functions these organizations serve in society

Figure 4-3. The content-centric “How to Cook Everything” iPad app feels more like a recipe book than like a place

Building architecture aims to produce physical environments that can serve and communicate their `social functions` effectively, and information architecture aims to do the same for information environments. The main difference is that instead of defining compositions of forms, spaces, and objects such as walls, roofs, and furniture, information architecture defines compositions of semantic elements such as navigation labels, section headings, and keywords, and produces the design principles, goals, and guidelines that capture the intended feeling of the place (e.g., is this a serious, solitary place, or a fun, social space?).

### Organizing Principles
One important difference between information architecture and building architecture is that the products of the latter are exclusive instances of a particular design in space and time.

Information environments, on the other hand, can be manifested in various different ways. For example, a website can look and feel very differently when accessed using a desktop browser with a mouse and a large screen than when it is accessed on the four-inch touchscreen of a mobile phone. However, navigation and structural elements such as section headers tend to use the same terminology in both cases.

As a result, the semantic structures that information architecture produces are more abstract than the products of other design disciplines.

### Structure and Order
The semantic structures in an information architecture also have `hierarchies` that indicate the relative importance of individual components within the whole.

Another common ordering principle in buildings is `rhythm`, usually the result of patterns evident in the structural grid, skin ornamentation, or both.

Rhythms and patterns are also important ordering principles in information environments, which change the way we perceive information. For example, how search results are presented can suggest different “beats,” with some environments requiring denser patterns than others (Figure 4-6).

Figure 4-6. When you “choose a department to sort,” the rhythm of Amazon’s search results changes

We also experience a strong sense of rhythm in information environments that show a constant feed or stream of similar information nuggets, such as Twitter and Flipboard (shown in Figure 4-7).

Figure 4-7. Flipboard users experience a clear sense of rhythm as they flip through stories with their finger, one at a time; in this example, we show the iPhone app, but this is true in the other systems in which Flipboard is available as well

# I.Introducing Information Architecture
`Information architecture` (IA) is a design discipline that is focused on making information findable and understandable.

## 1.The Problems That Information Architecture Addresses
### Hello, iTunes

iTunes was not just where Mario listened to and organized his music anymore. Now it was where he went to:

- Buy, rent, and watch movies
- Buy, rent, and watch TV shows
- Preview and buy music
- Buy applications for his iPod
- Search for and listen to podcasts
- Browse and subscribe to “iTunes U” university courses
- Listen to streaming radio stations
- Listen to audiobooks
- Browse and listen to music shared by others in his household

Later, when Mario bought his first iPhone, he was surprised to discover that the functionality that he was used to having in iTunes on the Mac (music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, etc.) had now been “unbundled” into various apps, as shown in Figure 1-4.

### The Problems Information Architecture Addresses
Mario was experiencing two problems:

- The tool he used to manage and navigate his simple library of 40 or so music albums had changed into one that dealt with hundreds of millions of different data objects of various types (songs, movies, TV shows, apps, podcasts, radio streams, university lectures, and more), each with different organization schemes, business rules (e.g., restrictions on which device he is allowed to play back his rented movie on within the next 24 hours), and ways of interacting with the information (e.g., viewing, subscribing, playing, transcoding, etc.).
- The functions provided by this tool were no longer constrained to Mario’s computer; they are now available across multiple devices, including his iPhone, iPod, Apple TV, CarPlay, and Apple Watch. Each of these devices brings with it different constraints and possibilities that define what they can (and cannot) do with these information structures (e.g., “Siri, play ‘With a Little Help from My Friends’”), and Mario doesn’t experience them as a consistent, coherent interaction model.

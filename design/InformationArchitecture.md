# I.Introducing Information Architecture
`Information architecture` (IA) is a design discipline that is focused on making information findable and understandable.

## 1.The Problems That Information Architecture Addresses
### Recap
- Historically, information has shown a tendency to dematerialize, going from having a one-to-one relationship with its containers to being completely detached from its containers (as is the case with our digital information).
- This has had two important effects in our time: information is more abundant than ever before, and we have more ways of interacting with it than ever before.
- Information architecture is focused on making information findable and understandable. Because of this, it is uniquely well suited to address these issues.
- It does this by asking the designer to think about problems through two important perspectives: that our products and services are perceived as places made of information, and that they function as ecosystems that can be designed for maximum effectiveness.
- That said, information architecture doesn’t operate solely at the level of abstractions: for it to be effective, it needs to be defined at various levels.

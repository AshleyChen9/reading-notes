# Chapter 1. Pattern Recognition
## Understanding Search
### The Box
In search, the first ball in the air is a `box`. It’s the iconic symbol of search and a great place to start.

The box comes in all colors, shapes, and sizes. It sports a variety of buttons and labels.

Figure 1-3. When is a box not a box?

On Flickr, we know we seek images, but we must learn how and why to query by tag and filter by interestingness.

Figure 1-4. There are many dialects in the language of search

As we begin to type, `autocomplete` offers to save time and typos, while `autosuggest` serves up Best Bets and related topics. Or, we can highlight a phrase in Firefox, drag and drop it into the search bar, and query a custom search engine using only our mouse.

Figure 1-5. Apple’s colorful version of autosuggest

iPhone users soon learn the rhythm of tap and type, understanding that the box has become subject to touch. Or we simply raise our phones to our ears and speak our search, relying on Google Mobile to derive what we want from who we are, where we stand, and what we say. No buttons. No typing. No clicks. Our identities, locations, and voices form a new kind of query that has us searching (and thinking) outside the box.

Overall, the various elements come together to create `system` of navigation. Though visitors might perceive this system as whole, we can dissect its individual components. For instance, the tabs at the top center of the page (starting with Home) are referred to as the `main navigation`. This page is in the News section. Within News, the `local navigation` is represented by a vertical menu on the left, which indicates where you are (Science/Nature is highlighted) and where else you can go, such as to articles about Africa or the business news section.

# I.Foundations of Web Navigation
## 1.Introducing Web Navigation
### Considering Navigation
Figure 1-1 shows a news article from the international version of the BBC web site (www.bbc.co.uk).

Overall, the various elements come together to create `system` of navigation. Though visitors might perceive this system as whole, we can dissect its individual components. For instance, the tabs at the top center of the page (starting with Home) are referred to as the `main navigation`. This page is in the News section. Within News, the `local navigation` is represented by a vertical menu on the left, which indicates where you are (Science/Nature is highlighted) and where else you can go, such as to articles about Africa or the business news section.

### Defining Web Navigation
Web navigation is defined three ways:

1. The theory and practice of how people move from page to page on the Web.
2. The process of goal-directed seeking and locating hyperlinked information; browsing the Web.
3. All of the links, labels, and other elements that provide access to pages and help people orient themselves while interacting with a given web site.

### Navigation Provides Access To Information
#### The content-linking-only model
Imagine a collection of pages linked to one another with no particular hierarchical organization or pattern of linking. All the links are embedded in the text. They aren’t isolated in a way that serves as a navigational scheme, and there’s no concept of a traditional home page. The site is just a big web of related information. Conceptually, it might look like Figure 1-2.

You might argue this would provide strong relationships between documents. A linked term or phrase on one page has a close association with the content on the destination page. But overall findability is low with this model. People wouldn’t have a sense of beginning or end in their search for information, and orientation would be difficult. Also, access time would be much longer. You’d have to scan the text in its entirety to get a sense of all related content. This is certainly not the most efficient way to access information.

#### The “liquid information” model
This is similar to the content-linking model, but there are no links. Instead, each and every word is interactive for all texts. There is no distinction between text and hypertext, or between content and navigation. All texts are links, and all links are texts. Figure 1-3 depicts this model. From a single word on a given page, any number of navigation actions is possible, leading to new content pages.

#### The filter model
Imagine accessing all the content of a web site through a single page. This page contains controls for filtering and sorting to present different chunks of material at a time. It would be highly interactive, for sure. A list of documents in the collection shrinks and expands with each interaction. Clicking on an individual item in the list would reveal its full text and images. Figure 1-5 shows this concept. A single control on a given page leads to new content, but that content is presented within the same page. The motion is therefore circular: you never leave the page, just continuously update its content.

Figure 1-5. The filter model

First-time visitors would not get a good overview of the type of content available on the site. It might also be difficult for users to know when a search is completed: you could potentially filter and sort all day and still arrive at new lists of content. Bookmarking and general accessibility are also complicated.

#### The search model
In this model of access, there is no navigation or linking to internal documents. Instead, visitors to the site can only perform keyword searches for information. Users type a keyword or two into a box and click the Search button. This produces a list of pages they can access. On the individual content pages, the only option is to return to the list or conduct a new search. Figure 1-7 shows these three steps from left to right.

Figure 1-7. The search model

Search is certainly an efficient way to get to content. We search on the Web all the time. But keyword searching is effective only if the item being sought is known in advance. It assumes that people will be able to accurately and completely express their information needs as a query. However, this may not always be the case.

#### The structural-browse model
In this model, there is only a set of links, perhaps on the side of each page, that provide access to information on a web site. This area is visually separated from the page content in the layout. You can click through a hierarchy of navigation options, refreshing the page content each time, as shown graphically in Figure 1-8. To get to a page in another area of the site, you’d have to navigate back up the tree and back down another branch. There are no embedded links within the text and no search function. Compare this with the content-only linking model, in which associations can be made in any direction from any page.

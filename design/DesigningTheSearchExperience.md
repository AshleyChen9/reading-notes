# 1.A Framework for Search and Discovery
The most fundamental step is to recognize that the opinions are themselves based on a set of **assumptions**—in particular, assumptions about **who** is doing the searching, **what** they are trying to achieve and under **what circumstances**, and **how** they are going about it. Each of these assumptions corresponds to a separate `dimension` by which we can define the search experience.

**The Dimensions of Search User Experience**

The first of these dimensions is the `type of user`, in particular his or her level of **knowledge and expertise**.
For example, consider the users of an online retail store: are they knowledgeable enthusiasts or novice shoppers? Likewise, for an electronic component supplier: are the users expert engineers or purchasing agents with limited domain knowledge?

Once we understand the user, we can move on to the second dimension: his or her `goal`. This goal can vary from simple fact checking to more complex explorations and analyses. For example, are users searching for a specific item such as the latest Harry Potter book? Or are they looking to choose from a broader range of possibilities, such as finding shoes to match a business suit? Or are they unsure of what they are looking for in the first place, knowing only that they would like to find a suitable gift?

Knowing the users and their goals, we can now consider the third dimension: the `context`. Context includes a range of influences, from the physical to the intangible. For example, is the user at the workplace, where the task and the organizational setting dominate? Or is the user at home, where `social context` might become more important? Perhaps he or she is using a mobile device while travelling, during which `physical context` shapes the search experience.

Finally, based on our understanding of the users, their task and the wider context, we can consider the fourth dimension: their `search mode`. Search isn’t just about finding things—on the contrary, most finding tasks are but a small part of a much larger overall task. Consequently, our focus must be on understanding the complete task life cycle and helping users complete their overall information goals. This includes activities such as comparing, exploring, evaluating, analyzing, and much more.

# 1.A Framework for Search and Discovery
The most fundamental step is to recognize that the opinions are themselves based on a set of **assumptions**—in particular, assumptions about **who** is doing the searching, **what** they are trying to achieve and under **what circumstances**, and **how** they are going about it. Each of these assumptions corresponds to a separate `dimension` by which we can define the search experience.

**The Dimensions of Search User Experience**

The first of these dimensions is the `type of user`, in particular his or her level of **knowledge and expertise**.
For example, consider the users of an online retail store: are they knowledgeable enthusiasts or novice shoppers? Likewise, for an electronic component supplier: are the users expert engineers or purchasing agents with limited domain knowledge?

Once we understand the user, we can move on to the second dimension: his or her `goal`. This goal can vary from simple fact checking to more complex explorations and analyses. For example, are users searching for a specific item such as the latest Harry Potter book? Or are they looking to choose from a broader range of possibilities, such as finding shoes to match a business suit? Or are they unsure of what they are looking for in the first place, knowing only that they would like to find a suitable gift?

Knowing the users and their goals, we can now consider the third dimension: the `context`. Context includes a range of influences, from the physical to the intangible. For example, is the user at the workplace, where the task and the organizational setting dominate? Or is the user at home, where `social context` might become more important? Perhaps he or she is using a mobile device while travelling, during which `physical context` shapes the search experience.

Finally, based on our understanding of the users, their task and the wider context, we can consider the fourth dimension: their `search mode`. Search isn’t just about finding things—on the contrary, most finding tasks are but a small part of a much larger overall task. Consequently, our focus must be on understanding the complete task life cycle and helping users complete their overall information goals. This includes activities such as comparing, exploring, evaluating, analyzing, and much more.

## 1.The User
### Novices and Experts
Expertise plays a significant role in how people seek information. Understanding the differences between novices and experts will enable us to design better search experiences for everyone. But first, it’s worth distinguishing between two dimensions of expertise.

### Domain expertise versus technical expertise
`Domain expertise` defines one’s familiarity with a given subject matter; a professional photographer, for instance, has substantial domain expertise in the field of photography. `Technical expertise`, on the other hand, indicates one’s proficiency at using computers, the Internet, search engines, and the like.

In combination, the domain and technical dimensions of expertise describe four types of users (Figure 1.1):

- Double experts
- Domain expert/technical novices
- Domain novice/technical experts
- Double novices

Figure 1.1 Two dimensions of expertise: domain and technical.

### Double novices orienteer
Double novices share three main characteristics (Hölscher and Strube, 2000):

1. **Frequent query reformulation**. Novices perform more queries than experts but look at fewer pages. Although they frequently reformulate their query, double novices often make only small, inconsequential changes to their search phrase.
2. **Going back**. When novices do click on a search result, they are much more likely than experts to then navigate back to the search page. With a fear of venturing too far from safety, double novices practice a hub-and-spoke pattern of information seeking with the search page firmly at the center.
3. **More time spent**. The many queries and frequent backward-oriented behavior of double novices causes them to spend more time on a given search task than would an expert.

Because novices frequently refine their original query but often don’t make radical enough changes, showing a list of related searches (as demonstrated by Foodily in Figure 1.2) can help users make more successful query reformulations. In addition, breadcrumbs accomplish the dual purpose of communicating the user’s current location, while also providing a path to go back (Figure 1.3).

Figure 1.2 Foodily’s iPhone application places related searches at the bottom of the page, after the search results.

### Double experts teleport
Double experts are characterized by three tendencies (Hölscher and Strube, 2000):

1. **More pages examined**. Double experts click on more search results than do novices.
2. **Going deeper**. Double novices tend to retreat from the pages they examine; double experts rarely go back. Instead, experts follow links from one page to the next, progressing deeper into the information space with each step.
3. **Less time spent**. Double experts are time-efficient in their search tasks. Not only do they reformulate their queries less often, but they can also determine the relevancy of a given page more rapidly than novices.

Expert-friendly search user interfaces should support advanced syntax and filtering to help users quickly narrow their search. Although the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT are certainly worth supporting, Wolfram Alpha (shown in Figure 1.4) goes a step further and allows users to input domain-specific terminology and retrieve computed answers. Similarly, a faceted search interface for filtering by format, selecting ranges, or excluding certain categories—such as Getty’s Moodstream, shown in Figure 1.5—can help users pinpoint content that’s relevant to their information needs.

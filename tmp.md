## 1. AI and Bot Basics
### Chatbots
If a human being analyzes both a bot and a human conversation and is unable to tell the difference between the two, we say it passes the `Turing test`.

Traditionally speaking, chatbots have used what we call a `retrieval-based model` . In this model, a programmer's code provides predefined responses, and chatbots learn in a heuristic way to pick the appropriate response.

#### Generative Chatbot Model
A `generative chatbot model` relies on predefined responses, and whatever we do, we should write them from scratch. 

- Open Domain:In an open domain, a conversation can go anywhere. There are infinite things to talk about.
- Closed Domain:In a closed domain, a conversation focuses on a single subject or topic. The chatbots evolve based on the kind of conversation we want: long or short. Short conversations are easier to use.

#### How Do Chatbots Work?
The best way to learn how chatbots work is to first understand the brain of bot. We call this a `digital brain` , and it consists of three main parts:

- Knowledge source: Where we need to find out which informations needs to provided to the bot so the conversation starts and for Q and A
- Stock phrases: Its something where we can handle general phrases of conversation which is used more often
- Conversational memory: When we are doing a conversation we have to remember the flow what has happened so conversational memory is required

When we start communicating with a bot, we may send a message (for example, “hello”), and the bot starts working—or more accurately, analyzing the message. The bot’s activity is known as `parsing`. Next the bot will look for keywords in order to reply to the message.

#### Rise of the Chatbots—Conversational Commerce
`Conversational` means it uses some kind of voice or text medium to transfer data and understand how people communicate.

The advent of conversational commerce allows users to talk to companies and have companies also talk back in an easy manner. This can happen in three ways:

- Bidirectional: That is the communication flow is faster and seamless within the bot
- Asynchronous: Allowing the messaging to be controlled at timely mannere and not within specified time intervals
- In real time: The communication response is to make it realtime

##### The Role of Chatbots
Chatbots work on the following:

- Basic operations
- Basic things answering the general queries with ease
- Basic questions

##### The Role of Humans
Conversational commerce is powered by humans. The UI developed is powered by humans. The structure (also called an `interface`) is designed by humans and is where the communication occurs.

#### The Structure of a Bot
![1-13](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/beginning-ai-bot/9781484237540/images/457478_1_En_1_Chapter/457478_1_En_1_Fig13_HTML.png)

We first start with `texting` with some questions, then we move to the `place`/`template` where we start developing or coding the logic of the bot here the response flow is generated. 

Next, we describe the `intent` that forms the basis of the bot’s communication, in order to provide a textual response and making the chatbot interactive.

We use `entities` to break the piece of information that is message flow to better understand what is happening for our usage to communicate. 

Finally, we create a workflow for the bot to get organized. This flow which allows the entire process to work efficiently it is either called a `dialog flow` or `form flow`.

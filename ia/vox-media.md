        - Vox makes it possible to assign even a commenter a story, then write it, have it edited and then published to the site within a single interface.
    - Content Creation and Publishing
        - all the data entry related to a story — adding links to previous articles, tags, categories, images, and any other  non-writing elements within the text editor. This process often takes up more time than writing the story itself, and the only solutions I’ve seen have been half-functional plugins.
        - automatically checks words, including a semantic comparison for related types of terms. “If you mention ‘Derek Jeter’ and say that he’s very good, and is going to be the MVP, the software will analyze related text and tag the post with his name,” 
        - A bookmarklet lets them save links to articles, photos and videos from around the web, then see a panel next to a story that lets them drag the content into the post.
        - The text editor includes a section that shows writers relevant licensed photos to use
        - a streamlined photo editor to help writers crop images to their needs
        - a tool for quickly uploading videos and photos that they’ve taken at events
        - when posts are ready to go, writers get an advanced set of options for promoting through social media.
        - There’s a promotion section for deciding whether to share with Twitter, Facebook, Google News and other sites.

        -  StoryStream:Readers can just keep a page open and watch for updates instead of having to constantly refresh the page.
        - The commenting system:Readers were using the section so much that they demanded shortcut keys for faster navigation.
    - Statistics
        - Vox shows editors how stories might do in relation to a big news cycle. For the NBA draft, suggests dates and times for certain types of stories to be published.
    - Revenue
